## Project for Palantir and recruiting

Heavily based off this github: https://github.com/mayooear/gpt4-pdf-chatbot-langchain

Differences from that project:
1) used data scraped from a website, not a pdf
2) used HNSWLib, instead of Pinecone
3) inferior model, not gpt-4 but gpt-3.5-turbo
4) When sources returned for an answer, the source name is a url to the part of the website where that information came from
